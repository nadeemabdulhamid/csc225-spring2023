# Defining Simple Methods â€¢ Using Conditionals

- Make a duplicate copy of your entire `hw01` project folder and name it: `hw02-methods`.


## Tasks

1. Develop the following methods in your `Aircraft` class:
   * `reconfiguredCargoArea`, which produces the total cargo area (in cubic feet) that can be obtained by converting the entire passenger cabin into cargo space. Each reclaimed passenger seat contributes about 35 cubic feet of cargo area. For example, a plane with 1000 cubic feet of cargo space and 20 seats in its basic configuration would have aa total *reconfiguredCargoArea* of 1,700 cubic feet.
   * `manufacturedBy`, which checks whether the aircraft is manufactured by a given company name (provided as a `String` parameter).
   * `sameManufacturer`, which checks whether the aircraft is manufactured by the same company as another given `Aircraft`.

    Don't forget thorough test cases.

2. Develop the following method for your `Rational` class:
   * `public String toString()` - produces a String representation of the rational number, e.g. `"1/2"`. (For reasons we will cover later, your method header should have a `public` annotation before the return type `String`, as shown.)
     * If the rational number is a whole number, e.g. the denominator is `1`, like `3/1`, then produce simply the numerator as a string, e.g. `"3"`. 
     * If the numerator is `0`, then produce `"0"`. Provide test cases for your existing examples.
     * Think carefully about other scenarios that could occur with the numbers.

    String concatenation in Java is performed using the `+` operator, like this:  `"hello" + "world"`.  If one of the operands is not a string already, Java will convert it to a string, like: `"hi" + 3` evaluates to `"hi3"`.
   

3. Add the following method to your `Rational` class. It uses Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Use it in your `Rational` constructor to ensure that the numerator and denominator never have any common factors by simplifying the fields as they are initialized. Work out test cases first and then ask for help if you are not sure how to proceed.

        // produces gcd(|m|, |n|)
        private static int gcd(int m, int n) {
            if (m < 0) m = -m;
            if (n < 0) n = -n;
            if (0 == n) return m;
            else return gcd(n, m % n);
        }
    
    After doing this, you may need to adjust some of your `toString` tests, because fractions should be simplified as they are constructed.

4. Develop the following methods in your `Rational` class:
   * `Rational plus(Rational that)` - produces the sum of this number and that
   * `Rational minus(Rational that)`
   * `Rational times(Rational that)`
   * `Rational dividedBy(Rational that)`

    One way to write tests might be to follow a pattern like:

        Rational x1 = new Rational(1, 2);
        Rational x2 = new Rational(1, 3);
        Rational x1_plus_2 = x1.plus(x2);  // 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6

        assertEquals("5/6", x1_plus_2.toString()); // compare the expected string representation

    You should put all tests related to a single operation (e.g. plus, minus, etc.) in a single test method in your test class. That is, define test methods named  `testPlus`, `testMinus`, etc., each containing several tests focused on that particular operation.

    Note the following formulas for rational operations:

      <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{c}{d}"> =
      (ad + bc) / (bd)

    - <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{a}{b}"> - 
      <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{c}{d}"> =
      (ad - bc) / (bd)
    
    - <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{a}{b}"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\times"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{c}{d}"> =
      (ac) / (bd)
   
    - <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{a}{b}"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\div"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{c}{d}"> =
      (ad) / (bc)
 
<!--
    - $\frac{a}{b} + \frac {c}{d} = \frac{ad+cb}{bd}$ 

    - $\frac{a}{b} - \frac {c}{d} = \frac{ad-cb}{bd}$

    - $\frac{a}{b} \times \frac {c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}$

    - $\frac{a}{b} \div \frac {c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bc}$ -->

<!---
(boolean equals(Object that) - is this number equal to that ? (You will need to ask for help from me on this.))

## Rubric

- Correct Java syntax: compiles & runs
- Methods have purpose comments
- Thorough test cases
- Methods implemented as specified (passes instructor test cases)
- Code style (indentation, spacing, class & field names, capitalization conventions)
