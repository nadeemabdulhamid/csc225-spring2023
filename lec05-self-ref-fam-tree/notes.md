# Lecture 5: Self-Referential Data • Overloading Constructors

# Objectives

## KNOW:
- That Java classes can be self-referential to capture data that contains references to itself.
- That Java programs should not have conditionals that check the type of an object.
- The “template” for Java methods contains **recursive** method calls on the self-referential fields of the `this` object.
- That you can **overload** constructor definitions in Java
  
## BE ABLE TO:
- Define classes to represent self-referential data

# Video Notes

- So far in class, have covered:
  - How to define classes in Java to model data
  - Write methods
  - Make decisions
  - Represent unions of classes (using interfaces)
  - Nested data
  - Concept of types in Java

- In this screencast: Self-referential data (something we've done a lot from CSC120 - 
            so we'll pick up an example from there and carry it over to Java)
- "Overloading" constructor definitions: defining multiple versions of a constructor, for convenience and flexibility

- Family tree example from CSC 120 (hopefully familiar...); remember the arrows in the data definition!
- Interface for family tree type; two classes: Unknown and Person

- In BlueJ, can create a test class that is not bound to a particular other class or interface for testing - use the "New class" button

- Constructors (and methods) can be *overloaded* as long as the parameters are different
