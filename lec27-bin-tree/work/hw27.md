# Binary Trees

Make a copy of the final lecture 27 code project and name it **hw27-bin-tree**. There are two tasks to work on below.

---

# Task 1 - Max Depth

Add a `maxDepth()` method to the `BinaryTree` class that produces the maximum depth of any leaf node in the binary tree. Study the example below to understand what the method should produce.

```
    @Test
    public void textMaxDepth() {
        String[] tokens = "2 + 5 * 4 - 7".split(" +");
        BinaryTree<String> result = ExpressionParser.buildExpTree(tokens);

        assertEquals(3, result.maxDepth());
    }

/* This is the tree built up above:

             -
           /   \
          +     7
        /   \
       2     *
           /   \
          5     4

The leaf nodes <5> and <4> are both at depth 3 from the root -- i.e. they are 3 steps down from the root.
*/
```

Hint: It may be useful to use a private helper method, `maxDepth(Node cur)` that produces the maximum depth of any leaf of a given node. If the node is itself a leaf or `null`, the depth is 0.

# Task 2 - Reconstruct (Challenge - Optional)

Add a method:
```
public static reconstruct(String[] preorder, String[] inorder)
```

to the `ExpressionParser` class that, given a preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, constructs the original binary tree. You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```

reconstruct the following binary tree:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```


Here is the example above as a test case:

```
    @Test
    public void testReconstruct() {
        BinaryTree<String> result
            = ExpressionParser.reconstruct("3 9 20 15 7".split(" "), 
                                           "9 3 15 20 7".split(" "));
        
        assertEquals("9 15 7 20 3", result.postOrderString());
    }
```

- Make sure you have figured out an algorithm to achieve this by hand before you start coding.
  
- As with the first task, it may be useful to develop a helper function with extra parameters to do the actual work of reconstruction. (My helper method had this header: `  private static BinaryTree<String> reconstruct(String[] preorder, String[] inorder, int preStart, int preEnd, int inStart, int inEnd)`).
