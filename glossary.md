- **object**<br>
  A "thing" in a running program that has some state (representing its "characteristics") and behavior (representing what it can "do"). Objects take up memory in the computer to keep track of their information. Every object has its own space in memory, so each object has a unique identity (even if it has the same characteristics and behavior as another one). Every object in Java is created (constructed) from a class. An object is also referred to as an **instance** of a class. (See [Section 5.1.1 here](https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s1.html#OOP.1.1).)
  
  The *state* of the object is stored in its **fields**. The behavior of the object is defined by **methods**.

  See **object**.


- **camel case**<br>
  A way of writing multi-word **identifiers** in Java where the first word starts off with a lowercase letter; all the words are written together with no spaces or dashes in between; and the initial letter of every word after the first word is capitalized, `justLikeThis`.

- **identifier**<br>
  A collection of symbols that represents a name for _stuff_ (variables, classes, methods) in a program.

- **comment**<br>
   Text within the source code of a program that is ignored by the computer/compiler. Often used to increase readability and clarity of code by explaining something to a human reader of the code.
