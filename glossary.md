- **object**

  A "thing" in a running program that has some state (representing its "characteristics") and behavior (representing what it can "do"). Objects take up memory in the computer to keep track of their information. Every object has its own space in memory, so each object has a unique identity (even if it has the same characteristics and behavior as another one). Every object in Java is created (constructed) from a class. An object is also referred to as an **instance** of a class. (See [Section 5.1.1 here](https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s1.html#OOP.1.1).)
  
  The *state* of the object is stored in its **fields**. The behavior of the object is defined by **methods**.
