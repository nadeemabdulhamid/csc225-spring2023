# Lecture 8: Abstract Classes â€¢ Packages

# Objectives

## KNOW:
- that an abstract class is a mechanism provided by Java to facilitate sharing of code and data
- that abstract classes can't be instantiated
- that a class can extend at most one other class (abstract or concrete)
- that a class can implement any number of interfaces
- how Java packages work
  
## BE ABLE TO:
- effectively design a class hierarchy for classes that have multiple properties and common fields and methods

# Watch (before class)

- [Abstract classes](https://mediaspace.berry.edu/media/1_bgby9dhw) [12 mins]

   This is a screencast that I recorded in a past year using a different IDE than BlueJ. Please just focus on the changes that I am making to the classes in the code. You can download the starter code and the final code from the ["lec080-abstract/start"](start/) subdirectory in this repository.

- [Packages in Java](https://mediaspace.berry.edu/media/lec-081-packages/1_1up9nm61) [9 mins]

# Notes (mainly for me for class)

- Work on `daysOverdue` task. Abstract as much as possible - lifting to parameter, field, and talk about static fields if time.
