For each lecture (corresponding to a 50-minute class meeting period), there is a directory containing:

- `notes.md`: a document containing
  - lecture objectives
  - video links to watch
  - practice exercises for class
  - (link to) homework assignment tasks
  - video notes (roughly transcribed or as used by instructor for prep)

and subdirectories:

- `start/`: initial starter code used in the lecture video(s)
- `final/`: the final code developed by the end of the lecture video(s)
- `practice/`: instructor's prep files for in-class activities
- `live/`: any code files developed live during class meeting
- `work/`: the text of the homework assignment
