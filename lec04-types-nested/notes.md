# Lecture 4: Types, Classes & Interfaces • Object Containment 

# Objectives

## KNOW:
- That types tell you what you can do with a piece of data in Java
- That a variable whose type is an interface can only be assigned to a class that implements the interface
- That when an instance of a class invokes a method, the method definition lookup is **dispatched** to the class to which the instance belongs
- That Java programs should not have conditionals on the type of an object (Java's **method dispatch** obviates the need for a conditional)
- How methods work when applied to objects

## BE ABLE TO:
- Design methods for objects with containment (i.e. nested objects), introducing helper methods as appropriate
- Draw an object diagram (memory map) with nested objects
