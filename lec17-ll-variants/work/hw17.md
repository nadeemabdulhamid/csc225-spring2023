# Tasks: Uno! (Circular doubly-linked lists)

Uno is a popular American card game developed in 1971. If you have never played it, Wikipedia has an article about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game). In this exercise, you are to write some code that could form the core of a software implementation of the game. For simplicity, you only need to deal with the aspects of the game that involve keeping track of which player's turn it is.

The starter code provided in the zip file you downloaded above contains a skeleton implementation of various types of cards in the game, as well as a `Player` class that is supposed to keep track of players in the game, including the current player. Each player has a link to the player sitting before and after him/her in the circle of players.

There are 6 methods in the `Player` class marked with **`*** TODO ***`** comments that need you to complete their implementation. Each method has a purpose comment (you should read through all the provided code anyway), and a test class is also provided so that you have an idea of how the methods are supposed to work.

I suggest you fill in the `Player` constructor and the `allNames` method first, and get the initial test to pass. Then work on the remaining methods one by one.
