# Binary Search Trees

Start a new BlueJ project named **hw29-bst** and copy the [BST.java](../code/BST.java) code file into it.

# Task 1 - Binary Search Tree Iterator (Guided Exercise)

Implement an iterator over the binary search tree (BST) code provided in class. Your iterator should be initialized with the root node of the BST. Calling next() should return the next smallest key in the BST.

If you need to review the concept of iterators, here's a lecture recording on iterators:

- [Code from lecture is here](../../lec28-iterator/in-class/)


## Approach

- Make the `BST` class implement `Iterable<Key>`.
- Add an `iterator()` method to the `BST` class which will return an iterator object. You will need to define a new class that implements `Iterator<Key>` in order to construct and return an object of it. Name your class `InorderIterator`.
- Your iterator object will need to go systematically through all the nodes in the tree, but in "slow motion" - i.e. only returning one at a time from the `next()` method. To keep track of things, your `InorderIterator` will keep track of a stack of `Node`s in the tree, so declare a field for a `Stack<Node>`.
-  To set things up, in the constructor (after initializing an empty stack), push all the left nodes starting from the root. This will push the nodes in descending order.
- In the `hasNext()` return `true` if the stack has elements and `false` if it's empty. (Do not use an `if` statement.)
- In the `next()` method, pop a node from the stack, push to the stack the right subtree of the node (if any), and return the node's value. (What we mean by "the right subtree" is all the left nodes starting from the root of the right subtree.)

You should trace an example of these operations out on paper to see how they work.

Make sure to test your code. (Create a test class, add some elements to a BST, then obtain an iterator object and check the results of `hasNext()` and `next()`.)


## Run Time Complexity (worst case)

- hasNext(): ùëÇ(1)
- next(): ùëÇ(logùëõ)=ùëÇ(‚Ñé)  where h is the height of the tree
- memory used: ùëÇ(logùëõ)=ùëÇ(‚Ñé) where h is the height of the tree

```

# Task 2 - Lowest Common Ancestor

Implement a method in the BST class:

```
public Key lowestCommonAncestor(Key k1, Key k2)
```

that produces the key of the node that is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given keys in the BST. If one or both of `k1` and `k2` are not keys in the tree, the method should return `null`.

According to the definition of [LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes *v* and *w* as the lowest node in T that has both *v* and *w* as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

For example, in the tree below, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

```
        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
```

## Approach

(You should first verify that the given keys occur in the tree.)

Since this is a Binary Search Tree, we know that the left node will be smaller than or equal to the root node and the right node will be greater than the root node. This basically involves checking the below edge cases:

1. If root is null, then return null
1. If both the keys given are same, return the key.
1. If either of the nodes is the root node then root node is the LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
1. If one of the nodes is greater than the root and another is less than the root then root is the LCA
1. If both nodes are smaller than the root, then recursively call the LCA function to compute steps 1 to 4 on the left node of the root.
1. If both nodes are greater than the root, then recursively call the LCA function to compute steps 1 to 4 on the right node of the root.

### Run Time

Assuming that the tree is balanced, worst case run time should be *O(log n)*. This is because each time we are either processing the left side of the binary search tree or the right side of the binary search tree.
