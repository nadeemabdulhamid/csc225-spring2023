# Task: Generating Text

Add code to the end of the `main` method that generates `WORDS_TO_GENERATE` (e.g. 500) 
words of new text based on the text model. Change the input file to the provided `"holmes.txt"`.  

- Start with the `start` prefix we saved earlier in the code.
- Construct a [random number generator object](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) (`Random`).
- Print out the initial prefix, then repeat the following steps:
    - Pick a random word from the list associated with the current prefix
    - Output the word
    - Shift the word into the current prefix (using `Prefix.addWord`)

# Task: Profiling

After the line where our code prints out the size of the hash table:

```
System.out.println(table.size());
```

add some code to find the prefix that has the largest associated list of suffixes with it in the table when run on the `holmes.txt` input file. 

Answer the following questions in a comment at the bottom of your file:

1. What is the prefix?
2. What is the length of its list of suffixes?

---

# Task: Prefix size

Change the prefix size from `2` to `3`. 

3. How does the generated text compare between the two sizes of prefix?
4. What is the most common 3-word prefix and how many suffixes does it have in its list?

# Just for fun

[Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/) is an online library of (legal) free eBooks. Many
classic works that are out of copyright are available for download in plain text format. (You
may notice, that's where the `holmes.txt` collection was downloaded from.) You could look
for another large corpus of text and run it through your `ChainWord` program to see what
it produces.
