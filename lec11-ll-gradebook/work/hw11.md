# Tasks: Linked List Gradebook

Add the following methods to the `LLGradebook` class. For this assignment, you should **not** put the method headers in the interface, because we do not intend for these methods to be common to all types of gradebooks, but only for the gradebook implemented with a linked-list. (In general, if a method is going to be a specific feature of a single class, then it does not need to be added to the interface that the class implements, because that would force all other classes that implement the interface to have to provide definitions for the method as well, where it might not even make sense for them.)

1. A method, `public int countBetween(int low, int high)`, which produces the number of grades in this gradebook between low and high, inclusive

1. A method, `public void removeLastAdded()`, which deletes the *most recently added* grade from this gradebook. If there are no grades (`this.head == null`), it does nothing.

1. A method, `public String toString()`, which produces a comma separated list of the grades in this gradebook. You may need to check special cases, like when `this.head == null` or `this.head.next == null`. 

1. A method, `public void addSorted(int g)`, which updates the list of grades in this book by adding the given grade in sorted order (descending). You may need to check two special cases, (1) `this.head == null` (in which case you can just add the grade as usual, `this.addGrade(g);`) and (2) `g > this.head.value` (in which case you need to make a new node that will become the head). Other than these two cases, I would suggest setting up a `cur` variable that walks through the list as long as `cur.next.value > g`. That it, as long as the node *after* `cur` has a value greater than `g`, then `g` needs to go somewhere further down the list. When this is no longer the case, then create a new node and link it into the list right after `cur`.

   (After you work on this task - `addSorted`, the `removeLastAdded` may not be entirely correct any more; that's fine. Ignore that issue for now.)

## Test Cases

Here are some test cases:

```
    @Test 
    public void testHw11() {
        LLGradebook llg = new LLGradebook();

        // PART 1
        llg.addGrade(65);
        llg.addGrade(89);
        llg.addGrade(100);
        llg.addGrade(82);
        llg.addGrade(94);
        llg.addGrade(86);

        assertEquals(3, llg.countBetween(80, 89));
        assertEquals(0, llg.countBetween(70, 79));
        assertEquals(2, llg.countBetween(94, 100));
        assertEquals(6, llg.countBetween(0, 100));
        
        assertEquals(0, new LLGradebook().countBetween(80, 89)); // special case - head == null

        // PART 2
        llg.removeLastAdded();
        assertEquals(2, llg.countBetween(80, 89));
        llg.removeLastAdded();
        llg.removeLastAdded();
        assertEquals(2, llg.countBetween(80, 100));
        assertEquals(3, llg.count());

        // PART 3
        assertEquals("100,89,65", llg.toString());
        llg.removeLastAdded();
        llg.removeLastAdded();
        assertEquals("65", llg.toString());
        llg.removeLastAdded();
        assertEquals("", llg.toString());
        llg.removeLastAdded();           // shouldn't do anything
        assertEquals("", llg.toString());

        // PART 4
        llg.addSorted(65);
        assertEquals("65", llg.toString());
        llg.addSorted(89);
        assertEquals("89,65", llg.toString());
        llg.addSorted(100);
        assertEquals("100,89,65", llg.toString());
        llg.addSorted(82);
        assertEquals("100,89,82,65", llg.toString());
        llg.addSorted(94);
        llg.addSorted(86);
        llg.addSorted(50);
        assertEquals("100,94,89,86,82,65,50", llg.toString());

    }
```
