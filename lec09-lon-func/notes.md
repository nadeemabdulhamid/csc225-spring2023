# Lecture 9: Linked lists intro - functional style â€¢ Exceptions

# Objectives

## KNOW:
- that Racket-style lists (empty + cons) are known as a "functional" data structure, and can be implemented similarly in Java
- why we might want/need more in Java
- what exceptions are in Java
  
## BE ABLE TO:
- define methods for functional-style lists in Java
- how to define an exception class and throw an exception to indicate a runtime error in your program
