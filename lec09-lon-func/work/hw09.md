# Intro to Linked lists (functional style) & Exceptions

# Tasks: Lists of Numbers

- Using the _`ILoN`_ definition of linked lists from lecture ([here is the code: lec09-lon-exceptions.zip](lec09-lon-exceptions.zip)), define the following **two** methods. (If appropriate at any point, throw an exception.) Make sure the code compiles and passes existing tests before you start. If the `assertThrows` test doesn't compile, just comment it out for now.


    ```
    // produces the number of times the value 'k' occurs in this list
    int howMany(int k)   




    // produces the number from the list that is closest (in absolute value)
    // to the given k. If there are two numbers equally close to `k`, return
    // the smaller one of them.
    int closestTo(int k)
    ```

    If useful, the `Math.abs` static method computes the absolute value of a number. 

# Tasks: Bags and Sets

- Compare the two classes below. A `Set` is a collection of integers that contains each element at most once. A `Bag` is also a collecion of integers, but an integer may show up many times in a bag. Both classes use lists of integers to keep track of elements - using the `ILoN` classes developed in lecture and the `howMany` method you just wrote.

    ```
    //a set of integers:
    //contains an integer at most once 
    class Set {
        ILoN elements;
        
        Set(ILoN elements) { 
            this.elements = elements;
        }
        
        //add i to this set
        //unless it is already in there 
        Set add(int i) {
            if (this.in(i)) { return this; }
            else { 
                return new Set(new ConsLoN(i,this.elements));
            }
        }
        
        //is i a member of this set? 
        boolean in(int i) {
            return this.elements.howMany(i) > 0;
        }
    }
    ```
    ---

    ```
    //a bag of integers 
    class Bag {
        ILoN elements;

        Bag(ILoN elements) { 
            this.elements = elements;
        }

        //add i to this bag 
        Bag add(int i) {
            return
                new Bag(new ConsLoN(i,this.elements));
        }

        //is i a member of this bag? 
        boolean in(int i) {
            return this.elements.howMany(i) > 0;
        }

        //how often is i in this bag? 
        int howMany(int i) {
            return this.elements.howMany(i);
        }
    }
    ```

- Develop examples of data and test cases for all the methods in `Set` and `Bag`.
 
- The two classes clearly share a number of similarities. Create a union and lift the commonalities into an abstract superclass. Name the union interface **`ICollection`**. Name the abstract class something appropriate of your choice. Donâ€™t forget to re-run your test suite at each step as you refactor the code.
 
- Develop the method `size`, which determines how many elements a `Bag` or a `Set` contains. If a `Bag` contains an integer *n* times, it contributes *n* to the total `size`.
