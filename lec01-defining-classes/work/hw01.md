# Defining Simple Classes

- Create a BlueJ project folder named `hw01-defining-classes`.

## Tasks

1. **Aircraft** can be classified by a number of common specifications, such as those listed in this table: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747#Specifications. Design a simple class to represent an `Aircraft`. The class should capture the **manufacturer** and **model name** (separately) of the aircraft, the size of the **cockpit crew**, typical number of **seats**, and **cargo capacity**.

   Write a test class with examples of a few aircraft. You can find some specifications on Wikipedia pages such as those linked at:

   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_(Bf%E2%80%93Bo)#Boeing
   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_(Ai%E2%80%93Am)#Airbus

2. Design a data representation (name your class `Rational`) for rational numbers that will support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A rational number has a **numerator** and a **denominator**.

    Don't forget a `Test` class with a variety of examples.

## Rubric

- Correct Java syntax: compiles & runs
- Includes specified fields, commented if appropriate
- Provides a boilerplate constructor definition
- Provides a representation comment (in /** JavaDoc notation */) for the class
- Defines a `Test` class for each task
- Defines at least three representative examples
- Code style (indentation, spacing, class & field names, capitalization conventions)
