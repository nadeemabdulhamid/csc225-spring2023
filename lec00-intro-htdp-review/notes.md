- everything moves over from csc120
- jumping straight into compound data definitions
- separate video about IDE workspace management
- types of fields as part of code
- constructor explicitly defined,  assignment statements 

- in Java, can't just throw things around in file - more structured, everything inside a class 
- different function call syntax
 
- identifier naming rules
 
- Dillo x = new Dillo(...) - seems redundant, but reason for it

- "object" -- new instance of a class, every object has copies of fields
