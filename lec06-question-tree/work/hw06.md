# More Recursion â€¢ More Methods: main, static

- Create a BlueJ project folder named **`hw06-question-tree`**.

# Tasks

Starting with the [final `QuestionGame` project files](../final) from lecture, add the following methods to the `IKNugget` hierarchy of classes:

- `boolean knowsAbout(String thingName)` - produces `true` if the given name is something that is known in this `IKNugget` tree

- `String allKnownThings()` - produces a string of all the names of things known in this tree, separated by commas; e.g.  `"a unicorn,a car,ice cream,a computer"`

- `String toString()` - which produces a string representation of this entire tree in the following format:
  - `Thing`'s should be produced with a `"***"` prefix in front of their name
  - `Question`s should produced with a `"---"` prefix in front of the question, followed by a newline (use `"\n"` to represent the newline character), followed by the entire `yes` subtree, followed by the entire `no` subtree. Note that each thing name and question will appear on a separate line. Here's what the result should be for the sample tree I defined:
  
        ---Does it have a horn?
        ---Is it magical?
        ***a unicorn
        ***a car
        ---Is it frozen?
        ***ice cream
        ***a computer


# Rubric

- Implements `knowsAbout`

- Implements `allKnownThings`

- Implements `toString`

- Code style (indentation, spacing, class & field names, capitalization conventions)

# Extra

- Add a `toJavaCode()` method to the `IKNugget` hierarchy of classes that produces a string representation of the Java code expression to construct whatever object the method is applied to. For example, in the `QuestionsTest` class, `top.toJavaCode()` should produce the string:
```
new Question("Does it have a horn?",
  new Question("Is it magical?",
    new Thing("a unicorn"),
    new Thing("a car")),
  new Question("Is it frozen?",
    new Thing("ice cream"),
    new Thing("a computer")))
```

- Write a new class, `QuestionTreeBuilder` with a `main` method that invokes a `static IKNugget buildQuestionTree(Scanner sc)` method to interactively construct a tree from user input. The following is an example of how it should run. The **bold** items are what the user types as input.

  Note: The `startsWith` method for `String`s will be helpful. e.g. `"Q: How are you?".startsWith("Q: ")` produces `true`.

<pre>
Let's build a question tree.


Enter a question, prefixed with "Q: " or else enter a thing.
<b>Q: Feathers?</b>
For the 'Yes' answer to "Feathers?":
Enter a question, prefixed with "Q: " or else enter a thing.
<b>Q: Flies?</b>
For the 'Yes' answer to "Flies?":
Enter a question, prefixed with "Q: " or else enter a thing.
<b>a hawk</b>
For the 'No' answer to "Flies?":
Enter a question, prefixed with "Q: " or else enter a thing.
<b>a penguin</b>
For the 'No' answer to "Feathers?":
Enter a question, prefixed with "Q: " or else enter a thing.
<b>Q: Fins?</b>
For the 'Yes' answer to "Fins?":
Enter a question, prefixed with "Q: " or else enter a thing.
<b>a dolphin</b>
For the 'No' answer to "Fins?":
Enter a question, prefixed with "Q: " or else enter a thing.
<b>a bear</b>

Here's your tree:


new Question("Feathers?",
  new Question("Flies?",
    new Thing("a hawk"),
    new Thing("a penguin")),
  new Question("Fins?",
    new Thing("a dolphin"),
    new Thing("a bear")))
</pre>
