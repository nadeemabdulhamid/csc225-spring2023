# More Recursion â€¢ More Methods: main, static

- Create a BlueJ project folder named **`hw06-question-tree`**.

# Tasks

Starting with the [final `QuestionGame` project files](../final) from lecture, add the following methods to the `IKNugget` hierarchy of classes:

- `boolean knowsAbout(String thingName)` - produces `true` if the given name is something that is known in this `IKNugget` tree

- `String allKnownThings()` - produces a string of all the names of things known in this tree, separated by commas; e.g.  `"a unicorn,a car,ice cream,a computer"`

- `String toString()` - which produces a string representation of this entire tree in the following format:
  - `Thing`'s should be produced with a `"***"` prefix in front of their name
  - `Question`s should produced with a `"---"` prefix in front of the question, followed by a newline (use `"\n"` to represent the newline character), followed by the entire `yes` subtree, followed by the entire `no` subtree. Note that each thing name and question will appear on a separate line. Here's what the result should be for the sample tree I defined:
  
        ---Does it have a horn?
        ---Is it magical?
        ***a unicorn
        ***a car
        ---Is it frozen?
        ***ice cream
        ***a computer


# Rubric

- Implements `knowsAbout`

- Implements `allKnownThings`

- Implements `toString`

- Code style (indentation, spacing, class & field names, capitalization conventions)
