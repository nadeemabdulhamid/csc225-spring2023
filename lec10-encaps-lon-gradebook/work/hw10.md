# Encapsulation/Information hiding

- Start a BlueJ project named `hw10-collection`.

- Take your `ArithmeticSeq` sequence class from `hw03` and have it implement the collection interface that you defined for `Set`s and `Bag`s from last class's homework. A class can implement multiple interfaces like this:

    ```
    class ArithmeticSeq implements ISequence, INumberCollection { ...
    ```

    For the `add` method, just `return this;` for now. Focus on getting the `in` method working. Here are some examples:

    ```
    ArithmeticSeq a1 = new ArithmeticSeq(10, 3);

    assertEquals(true, a1.in(10));
    assertEquals(true, a1.in(40));
    assertEquals(true, a1.in(16));

    assertEquals(false, a1.in(11));
    assertEquals(false, a1.in(7));
    assertEquals(false, a1.in(101));
    ```

- [Challenging] Now, can you get the `add` method implemented? This might require defining a new `class` which embeds a base sequence that has been extended with one or more additional arbitrary numbers. The new class will need to implement the `in` and `add` methods itself.
